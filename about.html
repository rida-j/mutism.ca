					<div class="bio-info">
					<p>Dr. Bork is the founder, Executive Director and Director of Research for the Selective Mutism Foundation. Having devoted over 15 years researching Selective Mutism (SM) including 6 years of active involvement in helping her son overcome a severe form of SM, Dr. Bork is dedicating her research in the efficacy and rapidity of SM treatments for children with SM. Dr. Bork is an active researcher who publishes in peer reviewed journals, and has been invited to over 30 organizations and schools to speak on the topic of SM. 

						<br><br>
						Her most recent study published by the Journal of Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry delineated the treatment of 3 young children with SM using a combined behavioural approach within school settings. Unlike most studies which documented lengthy treatment of SM (many were unsuccessful and lasted for months and even years), all children in her study were successfully treated, with each child receiving less than 130 minutes of treatment time within an 8-week period.

						<br><br>
With her background in Computer Science, Dr. Bork also actively explored the use of technology for SM treatment. She is the first (known) researcher to propose using software applications to help shape verbal behaviour (Bork, 2010). Over the past few years, she has designed and overseen several developments of software applications assisting individuals with special needs (e.g., SM, stuttering, intellectual and developmental disabilities, etc.). Some of them are currently available free for download in iTunes.</p>
