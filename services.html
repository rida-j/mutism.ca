	        <p>The Selective Mutism Foundation (SMF) is a registered nonprofit organization with the mission to <b>(1)</b> collaborate on education, awareness and treatment for Selective Mutism; and <b>(2)</b> enable individuals to find their voice and overcome barriers. </p>

	        	<p>The vision of the foundation is to be a respected leader in awareness, education and treatment for individuals who affected by Selected Mutism; and to provide a common ground where people with SM from all over the world can network and support one another.</p>

	        <p>Since SMF is a nonprofit organization (not a charity), we are not eligible for many, if not most, funding opportunities. Hence, your donation will assist us to carry on our mission, and continue to make positive impacts for those impacted by selective mutism.</p>

	        <p>Any amount is greatly appreciated!</p>

				<h1>Join our weekly drop in group coaching services.</h1>
				
				<p>This is an opportunity for parents to connect with one another under the guidance of an SM expert.</p>
				
				<p>The group coaching sessions are personally moderated by Dr. Bork and run every Saturday. Dr. Bork is renowned for her expertise in resolving severe, long standing, and resistant to treatment cases of SM. Not only has she successfully treated her own children while others have failed, she has also resolved many similar cases within hours (not months or years). It is no wonder parents and treating professionals turned to Dr. Bork for help when “nothing is working,” or the “progress is too slow,” or “my child stop progressing.”</p>

				<p>One study conducted by Dr. Bork demonstrated the success in treating children with SM within 130 minutes each of their time using the VSR technique is published in the peer-reviewed paper “Video self-modeling, fading, and reinforcement: An effective treatment of children with selective mutism” in Journal of Clinical Child Psychology and Psychiatry (2019).</p>

					<h3>Workshop</h3>
				</div>
				
				<div class="table-box-info">
					<p>	This workshop is designed for anyone who interacts with a child with selective mutism (SM) in a school setting. For instance, principals, teachers, speech-language pathologists, communicative disorders assistants, social workers, child & youth workers, educational assistants, psychologists, custodians, and librarians. Parents and other health care professionals will benefit from attending this as well.</p>
					<p>This workshop presents the most up-to-date resources on SM. These resources include case studies on  etiology, prevalence, effects of SM as well as assessment and treatment approaches. Additionally, participants learn how to set up an inclusive and inviting learning environment, and to provide accommodations for the child in the school.</p>
					<p>Furthermore, participants will learn why some school-based interventions do not work, and why the “VSR” method (coined by Dr. Bork) is the most effective approach for SM intervention.</p>
					<p>Ultimately, Dr. Bork equips participants with the knowledge to develop their own individualized SM intervention based on the VSR technique.</p>
